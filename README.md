# OConnor_et_al_2025_analysis
Code used for analysis and figures in O'Connor et al., 2025 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01757-6).

Code for formatting and analyzing output from regional MITgcm ocean simulations in the Amundsen Sea and adjacent regions. 
The model was forced by repeated atmospheric forcings for 5 years, revealing the oceanic and ice-shelf-melt response to various
cumulative atmospheric conditions. Output from the simulations were compared to proxy-constrained reconstructions of 
atmospheric circulation over the 20th century, for comparison to real historical conditions near West Antarctica.

The results reveal repeated northerly wind anomalies, interacting with coastal polynyas, as the primary driver of 
ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica. The proxy reconstructions reveal a significant
northerly wind trend in this region over the 20th century, suggesting that a historical strengthening of northerly
winds can explain the initiation of rapid ice-shelf melting in this region.

More details on the modeling setup and results can be found in O'Connor et al., 2025. The output from the simulations
and the proxy reconstructions are archived on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/15243743.
